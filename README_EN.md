---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Built with **Node.js**, supporting multiple deployment methods.


### Option 1: Desktop Client

You can now run LX Music Sync Server more conveniently via our Desktop Client, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **📦 Download Latest**: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/XCQ0607/lxserver/releases/latest)
- **✨ Key Advantages**:
    - **Single Window**: Integrated management dashboard and Web player for a unified experience.
    - **System Tray**: Minimizes to tray on close, ensuring the sync service stays active in the background.
    - **Port Conflict Resolution**: Automatically detects and switches ports if the default is in use.
    - **Setup Wizard**: Guided data path selection on first launch, supports **Portable Mode**.
    - **Multi-Arch Support**: Builds for Windows (x64/x86/ARM64 Setup & Portable), macOS (Intel x64 & Apple Silicon arm64), and Linux (amd64/arm64/armv7l deb/AppImage).

### Option 2: Containerized Deployment via Docker

This project supports pulling images from Docker Hub or GitHub Packages:
- **Docker Hub**: `xcq0607/lxserver:latest`
- **GitHub Packages**: `ghcr.io/xcq0607/lxserver:latest`

**Docker Run Example:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 9527:9527 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/server/data \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/server/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/cache:/server/cache \
  -v $(pwd)/music:/server/music \
  --name lx-sync-server \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  xcq0607/lxserver:latest
```

**Docker Compose Example:**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  lx-sync-server:
    image: xcq0607/lxserver:latest
    container_name: lx-sync-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9527:9527"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/server/data
      - ./logs:/server/logs
      - ./cache:/server/cache
      - ./music:/server/music
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      # - FRONTEND_PASSWORD=123456
      # - ENABLE_WEBPLAYER_AUTH=true
      # - WEBPLAYER_PASSWORD=yourpassword
      # - ADMIN_PATH=
      # - PLAYER_PATH=/music
```

### Option 3: Manual Run (Git Clone)

```bash
# 1. Clone project
git clone https://github.com/XCQ0607/lxserver.git && cd lxserver

# 2. Install dependencies and build
npm ci && npm run build

# 3. Start service
npm start
```

### Option 4: Using Release Build

1. Download the archive from GitHub Releases.
2. Extract and run `npm install --production`.
3. Execute `npm start`.

### 3. Access Info

- **Web Player**: `http://your-ip:9527/music` (Default path, configurable via `PLAYER_PATH`)
- **Sync Dashboard**: `http://your-ip:9527` (Default path, configurable via `ADMIN_PATH`, default password: `123456`)

## 🏗️ Architecture

Separated frontend and backend architecture based on Node.js:

- **Backend (Express + WebSocket)**: Core sync logic and WebDAV backup.
- **Console (Vanilla JS)**: Located in the root directory, handles user and data management.
- **WebPlayer (Vanilla JS)**: Handles music playback, default access path is `/music`.

---

## 🛡️ Data Collection & Privacy

Anonymous telemetry via PostHog is used for:

1. **Bug Tracking**: Version number and environment type.
2. **Notifications**: **Update alerts** and **maintenance notices**.

- **Totally Anonymous**: No IP, username, or playlist content is collected.
- **How to Disable**: Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`. **Note: Disabling this prevents receiving update notifications.**
